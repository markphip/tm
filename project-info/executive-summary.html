June 30, 2006: 
RSE milestone 3 (M3) has been posted on time on June 30, 2006. 
We are mostly on track with our 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/development/plan.php">
project plan</a>, except features "import/export" and "user actions"
which may need to be excluded from the 1.0 release.
Community interest remains high: WindRiver, Freescale and MontaVista
have started adopting RSE in their own projects.
A great deal of testing has already been done on all components of RSE, so 
bugzilla quite accurately mirrors the quality state of the product. We continue
to strive for increasing quality and fostering active community participation.
