The Target Management project creates data models and frameworks
to configure and manage remote (mainframe down to embedded) systems,
their connections, and their services. As a part of the Ganymede
coordinate release train, we provide connectivity to remote file
systems for other projects to use.
<p>
Our Vision is to be the Eclipse "Explorer of the Network Neighborhood",
with pluggable information providers under a single, consistent UI.
Interactively discover, drill down, analyze remote systems,
and provide the context for more advanced actions being plugged in to it. 
<p>
Currently, the TM Community is further growing, a
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/TM_Future_Planning">TM 3.0 project plan 
</a> is available on the Wiki, with the Community involved in 
these discussions. Development focus for TM 3.0 is on performance,
scalability and stability.
<!-- We are looking forward to getting first
