April 10, 2006: 
Eclipse IP/Legal Review of the first RSE submission has been completed successfully.
Due to the long time the IP review took, the M1 milestone of RSE had to be moved
by two weeks (new M1 target date: April 21, 2006). All other milestone dates
remain unchanged as per the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/development/plan.php">
project plan</a>, so the project is still on track.
