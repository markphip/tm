<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/downloads/drops/S-2.0M6a-200704111818/index.php">TM 2.0M6a</a>
has been released, providing good 
<a href="http://tmober.blogspot.com/2007/04/target-management-m6-efs-and-webinar.html">EFS support</a>
and thus finishing another plan item.
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/DSDP/TM/Download_Stats_17-Apr-2007">Download Statistics</a> show that RSE 1.0.1 downloads are at 2300 while
recent 2.0 milestone downloads are at about 570, mostly through the 
<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/releases/europa">Europa Discovery site</a>.
The <a href="http://live.eclipse.org/node/229">TM Webinar</a> 
on April 12 had 42 listeners peak attendance, and feedback was very positive.
Mailing list and newsgroup activity is also growing, and we are frequently 
getting community contributions of code (2 larger ones are currently pending
Legal Review on bugzilla). So over all the communities are growing very well.
<p>
For the upcoming 2.0M7 milestone, we still have some refactorings in the queue, 
but over all we are on track with our plan, and especially the pending improvements 
for the persistence providers look very promising.
