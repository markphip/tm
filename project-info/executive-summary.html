May 22, 2006: 
RSE milestone 2 (M2) has been posted on time on May 19, 2006. 
We have updated the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/development/plan.php">
project plan</a> to account for our slow start due to delayed IP Reviews,
and we are confident that all new plan deliverables can be made on time.
Community interest remains to be high as shown in the phone conferences.
A great deal of testing has already been done on all components of RSE, so 
bugzilla quite accurately mirrors the quality state of the product. We continue
to strive for increasing quality and fostering active community participation.
