August 18, 2006: 
RSE milestone 4 (M4) has been posted with 1 week delay on August 18, 2006. 
All blocking bugs have been fixed, and thanks to extensive testing, bugzilla 
contains a big number of minor isues or enhancement requests. The toolkit is 
now safely usable by end-users, and we plan spreading it among committers 
as a tool for them. To foster this, we're also planning to join the Europa 
train as soon as possible.<p/>
APIs have not quite evolved as much as we wished, but documentation and
product structure have solidified such that we are very positive for a
1.0 release on track with our 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/development/plan.php">
project plan</a>.
Community interest has lowered a bit over the summer, but we were able
to grow the committer community and we know of several projects adopting
RSE in commercial products. We think it will be best to mark all API
as provisional in 1.0, such that the time until 2.0 can be used for
incorporating more community feedback.
