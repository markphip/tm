May 3, 2006: 
RSE milestone 1 (M1) has been released on April 28, 2006. 
Due to the long time the IP review took, the M1 milestone of RSE had to be moved
by three weeks. The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/development/plan.php">
project plan</a> will need an update to account for the recent delay.
Community participation has greatly increased with the first milestone, so the
project is somewhat delayed but still healthy.
