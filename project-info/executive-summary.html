<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/downloads/drops/R-1.0.1-200612151830/">RSE 1.0.1</a>
has been released, bringing a new Terminal component, enhanced CDT Remote Launch
and fixing 66 bugs. Bugzilla, News and Mailinglist show continuous growth
of interest and community. With the new Terminal contribution, another highly re-usable 
component is now available, that has already triggered great interest in 
the DSDP and CDT communities. It shows how besides the full-blown RSE
framework, another standpoint of TM is being made with small, re-usable
standard components.<p/>
Next goal is joining the Europa train with RSE 2.0M4 on Jan 4, 2007.
