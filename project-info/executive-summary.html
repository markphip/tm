September 22, 2006: 
RSE milestone 5 (M5) has been posted on schedule. Extensive
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/RSE_1.0_Testing">Release
Testing</a> is starting, showing a great deal of community support already.
All blocking bugs have been fixed, and thanks to extensive testing, bugzilla 
contains a big number of minor isues or enhancement requests. There have
been over 200 downloads with M4 already, and we expect continued growth
with M5. To foster this even more, we're also planning to join the Europa 
train as soon as possible.<p/>
Slight delays have been caused by very slow Legal Review of Apache Jakarta 
Commons Net, which has eventually been approved and added to the Repository.
We hope that we'll be able to integrate it for the 1.0 release, though it is
already pretty late.<p/>
APIs, documentation and getting started are in a good shape, and we are
very positive to successfully complete our

1.0 Release Review</a> successfully and on track with our 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/development/plan.php">
project plan</a>.
