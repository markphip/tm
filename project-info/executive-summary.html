<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/downloads/drops/R-2.0-200706270925/index.php">TM 2.0</a>
has been released on time with Europa.
All plan items could be finished, except "User Actions" and "Integrate Terminal into RSE".
A couple of bugs is open to be adressed in upcoming maintenance releases, but in general
we think that we provide good quality with 2.0.</p>
<p>
The TM Community is further growing, and discussions have started around
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/TM_Future_Planning">planning the 
TM 3.0 release stream</a> on the Wiki, with the Community involved in 
these discussions.</a>
<!-- We are looking forward to getting first
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/DSDP/TM/Download_Stats_17-Apr-2007">Download Statistics</a>
for TM 2.0 on Europa - last stas were at 2300 for TM 1.0.1.
