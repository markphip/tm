<p><b><a href="/dsdp/tm/">Target Management Project</a></b> <br />
The Target Management project creates data models and frameworks
to configure and manage remote systems, their connections,
and their services.<br />
Our main offering is the Remote System Explorer (RSE), which integrates
any sort of heterogeneous remote resources under a single, consistent UI
and allows transparent working on remote computers just like the local one.
Other offerings include a lightweight Terminal and a Network Discovery
framework.</p>
