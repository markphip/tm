<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the initial
release of the Eclipse Target Management Project, 
<b>Remote System Explorer (RSE) version 1.0.0</b>.</p>
<p>The Remote System Explorer is a Tool and Framework for working with 
remote computer systems. It forms the first release out of the
Target Management Project, to be augmented by additional plug-ins for device
specific connection schemes and tasks in the future.</p>

</ul>
<p>This project plan and associated requirements are the result of an
open and transparent process and includes input from those who have
expressed an interest in the project. That said, the success of the
project and its deliverables is solely dependent upon the contributions
from its community membership. If you are interested in contributing to
the project in the delivery of its stated goals, you are more than
welcome!</p>

<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of
release deliverables, release milestones, operating environments,
compatibilities and dependencies. These are all things that need to be
clear for any release, even if no features were to change.</p>
<p>The remainder of the plan consists of themes for the project's
milestones, with more detail on these and future capabilities found on
the project <a href="/tm/development/requirements.php">requirements</a>
document. Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to be added to
the Remote System Explorer, or some aspect of the project that is
to be improved.</p>
<p>As this plan represents the goals for the initial release of the
Remote System Explorer, it is expected and hoped that the project
will acquire additional requirements, a vibrant user community, and most
importantly, a plug-in developer community to utilize the RSE framework
for creating additional connection protocols, subsystem visualizers and more.
With this, it is expected that the plan will be adjusted during the
development cycle in order to accomodate the community to as great an
extent as possible.</p>

<h2><a name="Deliverables"></a>Release deliverables</h2>
<p>The release deliverables have the same form as is found in most Eclipse projects,
namely:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Remote System Explorer source code release, available as versions tagged "R1_0" in the project's
		<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.tm.rse/?cvsroot=Tools_Project">RSE CVS Repository</a>
		<!--
		and
		<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.tm.core/?cvsroot=Tools_Project">TM Core CVS Repository</a>
		-->
		.
	</li>
	<li>Remote System Explorer SDK (includes runtime, user and programmer documentation, with sources) (downloadable).</li>
	<li>Remote System Explorer runtime binary distribution (includes user documentation) (downloadable).</li>
	<li>Remote System Explorer examples (downloadable).</li>
	<!--
	<li>Remote System Explorer unit tests (downloadable).</li>
	-->
</ul>
<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>
<p>Release milestone will be occurring at roughly 6 week intervals. The
milestones are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Friday April 28, 2006 - Milestone 1 (1.0 M1) - stable build</li>
	<li>Friday May 19, 2006 - Milestone 2 (1.0 M2) - stable build</li>
	<li>Friday June 30, 2006 - Milestone 3 (1.0 M3) - stable build</li>
	<li>Friday August 11, 2006 - Milestone 4 (1.0 M4) - stable build (API freeze)</li>
	<li>Friday September 22, 2006 - Milestone 5 (1.0 M5/RC0) - stable build</li>
</ul>
<p>Lock down and testing then begins with M5, and progress through a
series of test-fix passes against candidates releases. 
Release candidate builds are planned as follows (M5 is
release candidate 0):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Friday October 6, 2006 - Release Candidate 1 - (1.0 RC1)</li>
	<li><img src="new.gif" alt="(new)" border="0" height="12" width="12"/>
	    Friday October 20, 2006 - Release Candidate 2 - (1.0 RC2)</li>
	<li><img src="new.gif" alt="(new)" border="0" height="12" width="12"/>
	    Friday October 27, 2006 - Release Candidate 3 - (1.0 RC3)</li>
	<li><img src="new.gif" alt="(new)" border="0" height="12" width="12"/>
	    Friday November 3, 2006 - 1.0 Release target date</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as no critical problems are found in the testing
period between two release candidates (one or two weeks),
a release candidate can be declared the release.</p>
<p>All release deliverables
will be available for download as soon as the release has been tested
and validated in the operating environments listed below.</p>

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2><a name="OperatingEnvironments"></a>Operating
Environments</h2>
<p>In order to remain current, each Eclipse release is designed to run on
reasonably current versions of the underlying operating environments.</p>
<p>The Remote System Explorer depends upon on the Eclipse Platform.
For this release, the RSE sources will be written and compiled
against version 1.4.2 of the Java Platform APIs (i.e., Java 2 Platform,
Release 1.4.2 SE), and designed to run on version 1.4.2 of the Java
Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. Since Java 5 is also used as
Eclipse Reference Platform, some testing of RSE will also
be done on Java 5.</p> 
<p>Eclipse Platform SDK 3.2 will be tested and validated on a number of
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_2.html#TargetOperatingEnvironments">
reference platforms</a>
(this list is updated over the course of the release cycle). The 
Remote System Explorer wil be tested and validated against a 
subset of those listed for the platform, plus some more (marked
<img src="topic.gif" alt="(tm-only)" border="0" height="16" width="16">
) for which contributors have have expressed special interest 
and volunteered to perform the systematic testing:</p>

<p>Eclipse and the RSE undoubtedly run fine
in many operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test.
However, since we do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for them.
Problems encountered when running Eclipse on a non-reference platform
that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will be given lower
priority than problems with running Eclipse on a reference platform.</p>

<h4>
Datastore Agent Reference Platforms
</h4>
<p>The Datastore protocol is the default protocol shipped with RSE for accessing
remote file systems, process info and shells. It requires a Datastore server 
(agent) running on the remote system.
This Datastore agent is shipped as plain Java Source Code together with the 
RSE distribution. It should run fine on any Java Platform, with additional
Data Miner Plug-ins that may be OS specific.</p>
<p>We will test and verify the Datastore agent on the following Reference Platforms,
which are a subset of the Platforms we test the RSE UI on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red Hat Enterprise Linx 4, Intel x86, IBM and Sun VMs</li>
<li>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9, Intel x86, IBM and Sun VMs</li>
</ul>

<h4>Internationalization</h4>
<p>The Remote System Explorer is designed as the basis for internationalized
products. The user interface elements provided by the RSE
components, including dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The
English strings are provided as the default resource bundles.
The default bundles will be localized to a subset of those
locales offered by the Platform. This plan will be updated to indicate
which locales will be provided and the timeframe for availability.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<h2><a name="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility and Dependencies</h2>
<h3>Compatibility of Release 1.0</h3>
<p>The Remote System Explorer will be developed in parallel with the
Eclipse Platform SDK version 3.2. Each RSE Milestone Release will be
based on the most recent Platform Milestone available at the time of
release. Therefore, the RSE initial release will be
compatible with Eclipse Platform 3.2 release and will publish binary 
and source compatibilities with migration guides on subsequent releases.</p>

<h3>API Contract</h3>
<p>APIs published for the 1.0 release will be carefully
reviewed prior to release, making use of "internal" packages for
unsupported and variable implementation classes. Client plug-ins that
directly depend on anything other than what is specified in the
published API are inherently unsupportable and receive no guarantees
about future compatibility. Refer to <i><a
	href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write
compliant plug-ins.</p>
<p><img src="new.gif" alt="(new)" border="0" height="12" width="12"/>
Though it is our goal to create stable APIs, being able to do so
depends on the amount of API feedback we will get from the community.
As described in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/eclipse-quality.php">
<i>Eclipse Quality APIs</i></a>, we will therefore mark all of our
APIs provisional. This removes the guarantee of 1.0 to 2.0 compatibility,
though we&#39;d strive to achieve that. We expect to get sufficient feedback
during the 1.0 to 2.0 development period to declare the APIs final.</p>
