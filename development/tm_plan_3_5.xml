The Target Management Project provides data models, frameworks and tools for working with
remote computer systems. The main deliverable is the Remote System Explorer (RSE), a
feature-rich integrated perspective and toolkit for seamlessly working on remote systems.
Besides that, we deliver flexible, re-usable components for Networking and Target
Management that run stand-alone or integrated with RSE.
</p>
<p>
In terms of interfaces to other Eclipse projects, we provide an Eclipse Filesystem (EFS)
provider to allow remote resources be mapped into an Eclipse Workspace. The DLTK and CDT
projects are other Eclipse projects known to integrate with Target Management. PTP and PDT
can use TM services via the underlying DLTK and CDT layers. Several Eclipse Packages
include TM  (The Eclipse for Web package, for instance, includes the TM Terminal).

The WinCE subsystems are deprecated in this release.</p>
<p>
All stand-alone components will have an integration part that makes them work inside the
RSE framework. For that reason, there are no downloadable stand-alone component tests, but
the RSE unit test component will also have tests for the stand-alone components.

<p>
<a name="m_target_environments">In order</a>
to remain current, each Eclipse release is designed to run on
reasonably current versions of the underlying operating environments.
</p>
<p>
The Target Management Project 3.5 depends upon on the Eclipse Platform 4.3.
For this release, the RSE sources will be written and compiled
against Java SE 6, and are designed to run on that version as well.
</p> 
<p>
The Target Management deliverables will be tested and validated against a small
subset of the reference platforms listed in the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/eclipse_project_plan_4_3.xml#target_environments">Eclipse Platform 4.3 Project Plan</a>
(this list is updated over the course of the release cycle).</p>

<p>
Apple Mac OS X 10.8 is considered a "secondary" Reference Platform
meaning that it does receive some amount of systematic testing but
doesn't enjoy quite the same priority for bug fixes as the other
Platforms.
</p>
<p>
Eclipse and Target Management undoubtedly run fine
in many operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test.
However, since we do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for them.
Problems encountered when running Target Management on a non-reference platform
that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will be given lower
priority than problems with running Target Management on a reference platform.
</p>
<p>
Although untested, Target Management should work fine on other OSes that 
support the same window system. For more details, see the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/eclipse_project_plan_4_3.xml#target_environments">Eclipse Platform 4.3 Project Plan</a>.
</p>
<h4>Datastore Agent Reference Platforms</h4>
<p>
The Datastore protocol is the default protocol shipped with RSE for
accessing remote file systems, process info and shells. It requires a
Datastore server (agent) running on the remote system.
This Datastore agent is shipped as plain Java Source Code together with the 
RSE distribution. It should run fine on any Java Platform, with additional
Data Miner Plug-ins that may be OS specific.
</p>
<p>
We will test and verify the Datastore agent on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, Intel x86, IBM 1.6 VM
</p>
</div>

<p:internationalization>
<div>
<p>
The Remote System Explorer is designed as the basis for internationalized
products. The user interface elements provided by the RSE
components, including dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The
English strings are provided as the default resource bundles.
The default bundles will be localized to a subset of those
locales offered by the Platform. This plan will be updated to indicate
which locales will be provided and the timeframe for availability.

<p:compatibility_with_previous_releases>
<div>
<p>
<a name="m_compatibility">Target Management 3.5</a> will be backward compatible with TM 3.4.
</p>
<p>
<strong>API Contract Compatibility:</strong> Target Management 3.5 will be 
compatible with TM 3.4 as per the constraints documented in the TM 3.4 API Docs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</strong> Target Management 3.5 will be 
binary compatible with TM 3.4. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Source Compatibility:</strong> Target Management 3.5 will not be 
source compatible with TM 3.4 as there will be changes in internal interfaces.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Workspace Compatibility:</strong> We intend to keep Target Management
3.5 upwards workspace-compatible with TM 3.4 unless noted. 
This means that workspaces and projects created with TM 3.4 can be successfully 
opened by Target Management 3.5 and upgraded to a 3.5 workspace.
This includes especially TM 3.4 connection definitions, which may propagate 
between workspaces via file copying or team repositories.
User interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is upgraded.
Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. 
A workspace created (or opened) by a product based on TM 3.5 may be unusable 
with a product based on TM 3.4.
</p>
<h3>API Contract</h3>
<p>
APIs published for the Target Management 3.5 release will be reviewed
prior to release, making use of "internal" packages for
unsupported and variable implementation classes. Client plug-ins that
directly depend on anything other than what is specified in the
published API are inherently unsupportable and receive no guarantees
about future compatibility. Refer to <i><a
href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-API-Use/index.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write
compliant plug-ins.

<p:themes_and_priorities>
<p:preamble>
<div>
<p>
Plan items listed 
<a name="m_themes">below</a> were defined according to contributor requirements,
but in accordance with the Target Management
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tm/doc/TM_Use_Cases_v1.1c.pdf">
Use Cases Document</a> and the Eclipse
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RequirementsCouncilThemesAndPriorities#Embedded_Device_Software">
Themes and Priorities</a>
set forth by the Eclipse Requirements Council.
Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to be added to the 
Target Management deliverables, or some aspect of the Target 
Management Project that is to be improved. Each plan item has its 
own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a 
concise summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the 
work item at a suitably high enough level so that everyone can 
readily understand what the work item is without having to understand
the nitty-gritty detail. 
</p>
<p>
Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
large, others, quite small. Although some plan items are for work that is 
more pressing than others, the plan items appear in no particular order.
See the corresponding bugzilla items for up-to-date status information on
ongoing work and planned delivery milestones.
</p>
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
decided to address for the release. In bugzilla, this is reflected by
having a concrete target milestone assigned.</li>
<li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
will either be committed or deferred. In bugzilla, such items are reflected
by having a target milestone "3.4" assigned.</li>
<li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
items at a later point. In bugzilla, such items are reflected by having
a target milestone "Future" or "---" assigned.</li>

For the 3.5 release we are updating our release engineering to use the latest Eclipse Foundation tools.
Required features include automatic
signing and adoption of Orbit, easy promoting to the Eclipse Servers and Kepler, 
running automated unit tests with automatic reporting of test failures to the mailing
lists, ability and description for running the releng build on any adopter's system.
We have adopted 
<a href="http://eclipse.org/tycho/">Tycho</a> as the standard build system at Eclipse in this release, and have our main and legacy builds run on the Eclipse Hudson instance.
