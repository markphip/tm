<h1>DSDP Target Management 3.1 - New and Noteworthy</h1>
<p>The emphasis on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tm/tutorial/">Target Management 3.1</a>
  release has been on solidifying and hardening existing functionality,
  so there are not too many new features to mention. Still, here are 
  some of the more noteworthy things you'll find in TM 3.1 (June 25, 2009)
  which is now available for <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/downloads/index.php" target="_top">download</a>.
  See the <a href="readme_tm_3.1.html">TM 3.1 release notes</a> for details
  on bugs fixed, known issues, noteworthy new API and other changes.</p>

    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Team Review/Synchronize with Import/Export </b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">In the Remote file system Export and Import wizards (<b>File &gt; 
    Import &gt; Remote Systems &gt; Remote File System</b>), users can now select the new 
    <b>Review/Synchronize</b> option. This allows to see changes between the remote and local 
    file systems before committing changes to/from a remote system.<br/>
    This new feature can also be used for just <b>comparing</b> remote folders with a local
    counterpart, provided that no team provider is associated with the local folder
    (a local unshared project with a linked resource pointing to the desired folder
    can be used as a workaround if this is an issue).<br/>
    Kudos to GSoC student Takuya Miyamoto for contributing this functionality.

    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Multiple Connections to the same Host</b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">RSE 3.1 provides the ability to maintain separate local cache locations 
    for multiple connections to the same remote host. This allows to correctly maintain systems where 
    different logins to the same host reveal different portions of the file system (such as multiple FTP 
    accounts on a remote web server), or when different ports on a gateway are tunneled to different remote 
    hosts (such as SSH tunnels).  By default, the RSE 3.0 setting of re-using the same file cache for 
    multiple connections is enabled but this can be disabled in the Preferences.    
       For details, see bug

   <tr>
    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Show in Remote Systems view</b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">This feature provides the ability to select a remote object in a given
    view such as the Remote System Details view or the Remote Scratchpad, and have it displayed in the 
    Remote Systems view. This is helpful for understanding an element's position in the file system
    hierarchy to navigate up and down.<br/>
    From the Project Explorer, the same action locates a selected resource in the RSE Local Files
    Subsystem in the Remote Systems view. This is particularly helpful for tar, tgz or zip archives,
    which RSE can browse into. It can also be used for comparing a folder's files by size, owner
    or other attributes in the tabular Remote System Details view.
       For details, see bug
       <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=160105">[160105]</a> and

  <tr>
    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Non-Case-Sensitive Remote Search</b></td>
    <td valign="top" width="70%">Users now have the option to match filenames ignoring
    case when doing a Remote Search. In RSE 3.0, filenames were always matched by case.
    In RSE 3.1, case insensitive matching is default in order to avoid missing expected
    matches. Note that from the subsystems shipped with RSE, only dstore supports 
    remote search.

    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>RSE Save Conflict Dialog Indicating Conflicting File</b></td>
    <td valign="top" width="70%">When RSE detects a save conflict, the dialog presented to the user
    now indicates which file is in conflict. This is especially important when performing a
    "Save All", or when dirty editors are scheduled to save during shutdown.

    Remote Systems view in order to change the order in which they appear.

    <tr>
    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>DStore File Cache Using Workspace Encoding</b></td>
    <td valign="top" width="70%">Files types which are specified to transfer in text mode 
    (as per the Remote Systems Files Preference page) are now locally cached in the default
    local workspace encoding (as specified on the Workspace Preference page). In RSE 3.0, 
    the local encoding was always assumed to be UTF-8; making the client encoding configurable 
    allows external non-Eclipse tools which only understand a specific encoding to be used on 
    the downloaded files. Only the dstore files subsystem performs this transcoding.

 <tr>
    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>RSE Telnet Terminal Subsystem</b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">  A "Terminals" subsystem for Telnet is now 
    available in RSE in addition to SSH <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=227569">[227569]</a>. 
    A Generic RSE Shell Service can now run based on adapting any ITerminalService <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=240523">[240523]</a>, 
    thus allowing implementers of a new protocol create a terminal service and immediately get the shell service from it.
    The SSH and Telnet subsystems have been refactored to leverage this new API and thus share more common code.

    <td width="70%" valign="top">The Remote CDT Launch now supports running arbitrary commands
before actually invoking the debuggee. This allows fine-tuning the environment on the remote machine where
the program will run.<br/>
But the feature can also be used to launch arbitrary applications on a remote system,
when a dummy cdt project is used and the "skip download" option is chosen.
