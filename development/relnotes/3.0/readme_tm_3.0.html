The Target Management Project has been focused on internal API Review,
Cleanup, Refactoring and Performance improvements for the Ganymede release,
but there's still some exciting news:

      allowing transparent browsing and editing of files on the CE device.</li>

      with RSE, providing better support for interactive remote programs on SSH
      connections.</li>
  <li>Configurable User Actions and Compile Commands now allow defining simple
      UI shortcuts for common operations.</li>
  <li>Connections, filters and user actions can now be shared with others
      through an Import / Export facility.</li>
