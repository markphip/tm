<h2>TM Release 3.0</h2>
<p>
The DSDP Target Management Project has been focused on internal API Review,
Cleanup, Refactoring and Performance improvements for the Ganymede release,
but there's still some exciting news:
<ul>
  <li>The Remote System Explorer (RSE) now has Windows CE connection support,
      allowing transparent browsing and editing of files on the CE device.</li>
  <li>The lightweight ANSI Terminal emulation is now also available integrated
      with RSE, providing better support for interactive remote programs on SSH
      connections.</li>
  <li>Configurable User Actions and Compile Commands now allow defining simple
      UI shortcuts for common operations.</li>
  <li>Connections, filters and user actions can now be shared with others
      through an Import / Export facility.</li>
</ul>
445 unique bugs were adressed, including 115 API change requests.
