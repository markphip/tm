<h2>TM Service Release 2.0.3</h2>
<p>
TM 2.0.3 service release includes 13 bug fixes compared to TM 2.0.2.
RSE persistence was made more robust, SSH connections
do not time out any more thanks to keepalives,
FTP connections can show hidden files,
and the Terminal optional input line got Ctrl+Space field assist
for quickly accessing its history.

TM 2.0.3 is 100% upward and backward compatible with TM 2.0. If you already have TM 2.0, you 
can "check for updates" using the Eclipse update manager to get it.
